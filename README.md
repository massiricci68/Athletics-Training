Always passionate about athletics....
This is an ambitious project of sensors to be attached to the top of the foot but also on the knee to record all the dynamics of an athlete's run.
They are wifi sensors that mounted a TDK-ICM42605 and a NodeMCU 1.0 module (ESP-12E).
I used the UDP protocol to send data at 1000hz.
